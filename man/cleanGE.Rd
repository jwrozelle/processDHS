\title{Clean and Enrich Geospatial Data with Facility Proximity Metrics}
\usage{
cleanGE(GEdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{GEdata}{A spatial data frame (e.g., an `sf` object) containing facility data with at least a `SPAFACID` column.}
}
\value{
A modified spatial data frame with additional columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{facID}}{Facility ID copied from \code{SPAFACID}.}
  \item{\code{HFwithin_5km}}{Number of facilities within 5 kilometers.}
  \item{\code{HFwithin_10km}}{Number of facilities within 10 kilometers.}
}
}
\description{
Processes geospatial facility data by assigning unique facility IDs, computing pairwise distances between facilities, and counting the number of nearby facilities within specified distances.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Copies the \code{SPAFACID} column to create a \code{facID} column.
  \item Calculates pairwise distances between all facilities using \code{\link[sf]{st_distance}}.
  \item Counts the number of other facilities within 5 km and 10 km for each facility.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(sf)
# Load your spatial data
facilities_sf <- st_read("path_to_your_data.shp")
# Ensure that 'SPAFACID' column exists
cleaned_data <- cleanGE(facilities_sf)
}

}
