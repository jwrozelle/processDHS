\title{Process Visit Action Data from AN Form}
\usage{
cleanAN_visitActions(ANdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{ANdata}{A `data.frame` containing the AN form data. Must include columns for 
visit identification (`v000`) and individual procedures (`c106a` to `c106y`).}
}
\value{
A modified version of `ANdata` with added columns:
\describe{
  \item{pe_bp}{Indicator for blood pressure check (1 = performed, 0 = not performed)}
  \item{pe_palpPresent}{Indicator for palpating abdomen for fetal presentation}
  \item{pe_palpHeight}{Indicator for palpating abdomen for fetal height}
  \item{pe_fetalHB}{Indicator for listening to the abdomen for fetal heartbeat}
  \item{pe_weight}{Indicator for weighing the client}
  \item{pe_anemia}{Indicator for examining conjunctiva/palms for anemia}
  \item{pe_edema}{Indicator for examining legs/feet/hands for edema}
  \item{pe_breasts}{Indicator for examining the client's breasts}
  \item{pe_vagExam}{Indicator for conducting a vaginal or perineal exam}
  \item{pe_swollenGlands}{Indicator for examining for swollen glands}
  \item{pe_ultrasound}{Indicator for conducting or referring for an ultrasound}
  \item{pe_fundalHeight}{Indicator for measuring fundal height with a tape measure (set to NA for certain countries)}
  \item{pe_none}{Indicator for no physical exam components being performed}
  \item{pe_visitActions_count}{Total number of performed visit actions}
  \item{pe_visitActions_pct}{Proportion of visit actions performed based on available data}
}
}
\description{
This function processes visit action data in the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) 
**Antenatal Care (AN) Form**, recoding selected physical examination procedures into binary indicators. 
It also calculates the count and proportion of completed procedures.
}
\details{
The function checks the country code (`v000`) and applies country-specific modifications:
- If the dataset is from **Haiti (`HT7`) or Nepal (`NP7`)**, `pe_fundalHeight` is set to `NA`.
- If the dataset is from an unsupported country, a warning is issued, and default processing is applied.

The function also computes:
- `pe_visitActions_count`: Number of performed procedures.
- `pe_visitActions_pct`: Proportion of recorded visit actions relative to the number of available variables.
}
\note{
The function assumes the dataset contains variables `c106a` to `c106y`, corresponding to various physical 
examination actions performed during an antenatal care visit.
