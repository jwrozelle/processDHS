\title{Summarize Sick Child Visit Data at Facility Level}
\usage{
cleanSC_toFCLevel(SCdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{SCdata}{A data frame containing sick child visit records. Must include at least the columns \code{inv_id}, 
\code{bypassSC}, \code{feeSC}, \code{feeAmount_SC}, and \code{waitSC}. If \code{facID} is not present, 
it will be created from \code{inv_id}.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the SC visit data at the facility level, with one row per unique facility ID (\code{facID}). 
The output includes:
\itemize{
  \item \code{facID}: Facility identifier.
  \item \code{SC_num}: Number of SC observations at the facility.
  \item \code{bypassSC_pct}: Mean proportion of SC bypass visits (ignoring \code{NA} values).
  \item \code{feeSC_pct}: Mean proportion of SC visits with a fee (ignoring \code{NA} values).
  \item \code{feeSC_avg}: Average SC fee amount (ignoring \code{NA} values).
  \item \code{waitSC_avg}: Average wait time for SC visits (ignoring \code{NA} values).
}
}
\description{
This function aggregates sick child (SC) visit data to the facility level, computing summary statistics 
including the number of SC visits, the proportion of bypass SC visits, the proportion of SC visits with a fee, 
the average fee amount, and the average wait time per facility.

# Assuming SCdata is your input data frame:
result <- cleanSC_toFCLevel(SCdata)
